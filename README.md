# INM701-Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Coursework

Work that demonstrates a comprehensive
knowledge of the subject area and addresses the assessment criteria in full. Work will show
evidence of independent reading, thinking and analysis, or creative problem solving. The report
will be well-constructed and demonstrate a professional approach to academic practice. It will
be of a professional standard.

1. Describe a machine learning problem and apply artificial intelligence techniques to that
problem.
2. Use AI techniques covered in the module to apply, compare, contrast and critically evaluate
at least two ways of analysing your problem data.
3. Describe the systematic application of your chosen artificial intelligence methodology to
the chosen problem (for example, data preparation, parameter tuning).

• Define the problem domain and dataset(s) (you are free to choose the domain and the
dataset that you want to investigate).
• Define questions and analysis tasks (a brief overview of the domain, the questions that
are being asked, a list of your objectives and the expected output(s) of your analysis).
• Perform an initial investigation of the dataset and the characteristics of the data. Develop
a plan as to how you might transform the data to make it useable.
• Develop a plan as to which artificial intelligence techniques you might use and what sorts
of potential observations these can lead to, and how you will evaluate these.
• Use models taught in the module. You must use models taught in the module, these are:
perceptron, decision trees, linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, knearest neighbour, naïve Bayes, neural networks as well as unsupervised techniques kmeans and GMM, and principal component analysis. Most supervised models have both
classification and regression variants. You are encouraged to work with neural networks.
An additional technique from outside the taught module content might be applied for
comparison purposes, if this is done it should be clearly indicated and well justified.
• Split your dataset (train/validate/test, some datasets come pre-split). If you have a holdout
test set then you most likely don’t want to use this until the near the end of your work.
• Perform the analysis. Get the data ready for analysis, carry out your analysis/modelling
as needed, validate your results and communicate observations, iterating through this
process. Analytical operations can include data processing to an extent that is needed
(not all datasets are messy) to prepare a useful and robust dataset to work within, and data
derivation (such as feature engineering).
• You might establish a baseline result first, computing metrics on training and validation
sets, analyse errors, work on succeeding iterations, and alternative models. (If initial
baseline results are amazing and there are no errors is the problem too easy?)
• Generally, be close to your data (visualise the dataset, collect summary statistics, look at
errors, analyse how different parameters affect performance, try out different model
variants).


Your final report should cover each of the aspects above (and any other element of your work
that you believe should be reported). Graphical illustration of your results is expected (perhaps
training/testing error curves, confusion matrices, algorithm outputs, etc), as well as results.
Figures and Tables should be numbered and described. Following the above analytical
process, make sure that in your report you answer the following questions where appropriate
(this is **not** a report structure):
• What is your dataset, problem domain?
• Is your model classification or regression?
• Did you have any missing, corrupt or misleading data? If so, how did you cope it?
• Have you omitted some data? If so, why?
• Did you apply techniques to understand your dataset?
• How did you encode the input variables?
• What models did you use?
• What are the criteria for selecting model performance evaluation tools?
• What were your outputs?
• Did you have any problems or difficulties working with the dataset?
You should present the results clearly and concisely and provide a discussion of the results,
with conclusions related to problem being addressed. The conclusions section might propose
some further work based on the results of this coursework.
