## 🎶 Project Description

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the popularity of songs based on their features such as tempo, danceability, energy, acousticness, liveness, and valence. 
This data enables building models to map audio attributes to popularity.

## 🤔 Research Questions:
What are the key factors that predict a song's popularity on Spotify?
How do different acoustic features of a song (like danceability, energy, key, and loudness) correlate with its popularity?
Does the popularity of an artist influence the popularity of their songs?
Are there any temporary trends in song popularity?

## 🎯 Objectives:
The main objective is to accurately estimate the popularity of a song based on its audio features like tempo, danceability, etc.
Additional objectives include:
1. Understand the structure and quality of the data. Clean and preprocess the datasets for analysis.
2. Create new features that help predict song popularity, such as extracting the year from the release date.
3. Apply various machine learning models to predict song popularity.
4. Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models and compare the results.
5. Identify the most important features influencing song popularity.

## ⚙️ Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing: Fill missing values, handle outliers, normalising features.
3. Exploratory Analysis: Understanding the data, feature distributions, correlations.
4. Feature Selection: Choosing features to the popularity being the target variable.
5. Model Training: Training models like linerar regression and random forest.
6. Evaluation: Comparng model accuracy, chosing best performing model.

## 📈 Results:
The final Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of 77% in predicting song popularity from audio features.
